Difference between composition and aggregation 
---------------------------------------------------

# Composition -->

1. University and Department --> University is a container object because university contains, departments, lly departments is the contained object
2. Without existing container object if there is no chance of existing contained objects then container and contained objects are strongly associated, and this strong association is nothing but composition

# Aggregation --> 
1. Department and Professors --> Without existing container object if there is a chance of existing contained object then container and contained objects are weakly associated,
and this weak association is nothing but aggregation 
ex : Department consists of several professors, without existing department there may be a chance of existing professor objects hence, Department and Professor objects are 
Weakly associated and this week association is nothing but Aggregation

Very Important notes : 
1. In composition Objects are strongly associated where as in aggregation objects are weakly associated
2. In composition container objects holds directly contained objects, where as in aggregation container object holds just the ref of contained objects

When to go for Is-A and when to go for Has-A
------------------------------------------------------
If we want the total functionality of a class --> Is-A
If we only want part of functionality of the class --> Has-A
