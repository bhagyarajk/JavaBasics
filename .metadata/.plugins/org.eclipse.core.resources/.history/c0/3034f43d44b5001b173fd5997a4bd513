1. Interface can extends from more than one interface -> there is no ambiguity for methods and constructor chaining hence the multiple inheritance is allowed
2. PASF Rule : methods are public and abstract by default inside the interface where as variables  are public, static and final
3. Interfaces can't be instantiated 
4. Interface also allows concrete methods 
5. At that moment if the dev is not clear about the methods/ the features he can use interface so that he can simply declare that methods which on the later section they can implement them 
6. Use of interfaces increases the security, we are just exposing the important details
