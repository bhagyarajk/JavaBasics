concept of scp and heap
--------------------------
1. String is the only class in the entire java where you can create the objects by using new and without using new 
2. Whenever you use the new keyword an object is created in the heap
3. Every time you use new keyword a new object of the string in created in the heap
4. If you create the object using the string literals then the object will be created in the string constant pool only if the object with that content
not already exists, if the object with that content already exists the same object is returned 
5. because of this behavior of the scp, we need to make the string object immutable
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why we need to have this seperate scp for strings

1. In the day to day activities, string object is the most commenly used object 
2. And creating the string object every time is costlier for the memory 
3. When the object with the same content already exists then, why are you creating the object again and again 
4. but there is an issue with this concept, the same object is being returned for many queries, what will happen if any one of the user changes 
the object which is actually shared by many of the users, in this time we need string object to be immutable --> meaning if somebody want's to change 
the content of the string class object, with those new changes the new object should be created at the run time and the original object remains 
unchanged or immutable 

so to conclude 
----------------------
1. In order to return the same object when the object with than content already exits we have scp
2. In order to avoid the shared object modification by any one of the user we made the string immutable 
3. String var1 = new String("Hello"); --> two objects are created one in heap and another in scp (for reusability purpose)
4. 
String var1 = new String("world");
String var2 = new String("world");
String var3 = "world";
String var4 = "world";

Just because of the first line how many objects created --> 2 one in heap and other in scp
because of the second line --> again 1 object is created in heap and in the scp the same object is been reused 
because of the third line --> no objects created, same object from the scp re-used
because of the fourth line --> no objects created, same object in the scp re-used
