1. toString() --> String implementation of the toString() method is used to convert any of the given object to toString()
a. The default behavior of the toString() will return the fully qualified name with the hexadecimal hashcode

Packagename.Classname@Unsigned hexadecimal of the hashcode
Usually we override this toString() method to show the content of the object 

2. hashcode() --> this method will give the hashcode representation of the object
this method will generally converts the address of an  object to an integer using some algorithm
hashcode() method is the native method as it's impossible in java to find out the address of an object

use : searching of the object using the hash of the object makes it faster to find out 
hashcode is unique for each object so you can even compare two objects using this hashcode method 

Address of the object + algorithm ==> Integer representation of the hashcode
