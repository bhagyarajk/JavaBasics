		during compilation java has to ensure that all the properties of the class should be accessible anywhere in the project
		to make is possible it a resource intesive process, that is the reason there is a restriction put so that only one public
		class is allowed
		2. If there is a public class in the source file make sure the source file name should be given with the same classname and 
		incase there is a requirement for main method make sure you have the main method in the same public class
