Here is the runtime data storage for HotSpot VM In Java 8

Heap

Has got all your objects created using new, including String constant pool
Contains your fields/instance variables
MetaSpace(Method Area)

Contains static data(Class variables and static methods)
Data in here is accessible by Heap, JVM stack
Unlike <=Java7 PermGen which takes JVM process memory which is limited and can't be expanded at runtime. MetaSpace uses native memory
JVM Stack

Current execution of your program.
Contains local variables
It's a thread
Native Stack

Used for native method executions, as Java core language has some native stuff
It's also a thread
PC register/ Instruction Sets

Holds the JVM memory addresses(Not Native address) for each JVM instruction in your stack
Generally each entry in JVM/native stack refers to PC registers for addresses to get actual data from Heap/MetaSpace
Each stack is associated with a PC register
