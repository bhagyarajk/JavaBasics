git reset --hard commithash --> deletes all the new commits 
git checkout -- filename --> restore the working tree
git restore --statged or git reset path  --> to unstage perticular files/ all the files you can use wildcar *
git rm -rf --cached path --> how to unstage the commited files
git status --ignored --> The files ignored by the git some time you need to use the -s flag

Note : ref and reflog 
ref --> anything which points to the commit, you can use this ref as an alternative of using the commit hash, Head@2 means this is the reflog : which tells
the commit hash that the Head was pointing before two shifts(before updating the head 2 times)
.git/refs/heads --> will contain the branch names which intern contains the latest commits or the tip of the branch
